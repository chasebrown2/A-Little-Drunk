            Long ago in a galaxy somewhere near the equator lived a band.
            This band was no ordinary band being that all of the members 
            had only a slight drinking problem as is apparent given their name. 
            However, this band had discovered that they held the key to 
            saving the world; their music. Not only was their music an ode
            to the gods before but a framework for the new world order that
            would lie ahead.
           </p>
            
                <p>
            This band of misfits were now the last saviors of a forgotten world.
            Between them they had the mental capacity of a gracile Golden Retriever,
            with all the love and attention deficit to go with it. No other origin 
            story comes close to that of <strong>A Little Drunk</strong> purely due 
            to the sheer idiocracy that is the inhabitants of Earth.
